			<h2>Drivers</h2>

			<p>Driving by far is one of the most popular and convenient modes of transportation in the US. However, it still stands as one of the most dangerous modes of transportations, with fatal accidents in the thousands and injuries in the hundreds of thousands occuring in reported accidents every year. Injury severity must also be taken into account. While a driver might avoid a fatal accident, it can still place them in the hospital and cause permanent damage such as scaring or paralysis. There is a continual scury to make cars safer. A lot of weight is placed on the drivers to ensure they stay safe. Seat belts, head rests, turn signal bliners, head lights, breaks, break lights, air bags, the list goes on. With the introduction of new technologies such as backup cameras and the OBD II, cars are smarter than ever. Manufacturers have managed to substantially reduce accident rate. What could have been fatal accidents have become injuries. However no technology can be a substitute for a conscious driver.</p>

			<p>It is also important to note that drivers are not only a concern for other drivers. Cars and trucks are threats to motorcyclists, bikers, and pedestrians - being the larger and more abundant "tanks" of the road.</p>

			<h3>Statistics and Data</h3>
			<ul class='stats'>
				<li><p>10% of all drivers under 20 involved in fatal car crashes were distracted at the time of the crash. Distraction affected crashes resulted in 3328 deaths in 2012, and 421,000 people were injured due to distraction.<span class='source'>[1]</span></p></li>
				<li><p>18-23 year old males are statistically the most likely to both instigate and be affected by car crashes<span class='source'>[2]</span></p></li>
				<li><p>45-54 years old parents have the high percentage of car crashes (19.9% of all crashes), but these are typically not fatal (17.7% of all fatal accidents)<span class='source'>[2]</span></p></li>
				<li><p>Reaction time to expected event .6 -2 seconds <span class='source'>[3]</span></br> Reaction time unexpected event  35% increase<span class='source'>[4]</span></p></li>
				<li><p>1 of 3 deaths append because of side impacts (2004)<span class='source'>[5]</span></p></li>
				<li><p>25% of fatal accidents are due to drowsy driving<span class='source'>[6]</span></p></li>
