		<h2>What We're Doing</h2>
		<div class='block'>
			<p>The Santos Family Foundation is dedicated to improving vehicular safety for all road users. As part of that mission that have partnered with Olin College in funding a SCOPE team. This is a team of four college seniors working to make a huge impact on the way we look at road safety.</p>

			<p>For the 2014-2015 academic year we have chosen to focus our efforts on developing better, cheaper, and more effective infrastructure. Specifically, we have focused on data collection and how to allow traffic engineers in smaller cities and towns make better, more data driven decisions.</p>

				<h3>Kai Austin | Software Developer</h3>
				<p>Kai Austin is a computing engineer originally from the sandy, tumble weed deserts of Southern California, USA. He specializes in full stack web development, though does just about everything code and doubles as a fairly active fiction writer. His prefered mode of transportation - if you can get him outside - is either walking or riding bikes as he is mildly terrified of giant, fast moving objects.</p>

				<h3>Alvaro Antunez Seoane | Telecommunications Engineer</h3>
				<p>Alvaro is awesome, but I can never remember his last name.</p>

				<h3>James Nee | Mechanical Engineer</h3>
				<p>James has been working on this project for too long.</p>

				<h3>Olin College of Engineering | <a href='http://www.olin.edu/'>Website</a></h3>
				<p>Residing in the outskirts of Boston, Massachusetts, Olin was founded to start a revolution in engineering education with rigorous, innovative, and project based curriculum and passionate students who think differently. Every year, seniors participate in SCOPE (Senior Capstone Olin Project Experience) where they work for a year with real companies to solve real problems.</p>
				<p>Our SCOPE team is sponsered by the Santos Family Foundation, with the task and challenge of making driving safer for all road users.</p>

				<h3>Santos Family Foundation | <a href='http://fdnweb.org/santos/'>Website</a></h3>
				<p>"The Santos Family Foundation is dedicated to the memory of Robin Santos and her three children, Cristina, Paul Christopher and Peter Santos. All four died in an automobile collisionin New Hampshire in 1990. Paul Santos, Jr., Robinâ€™s husband and the father of the three children, survived the collision.

				<p>The Foundation focuses on improving automobile safety, particularly the crash-worthiness of passenger vehicles."</p>
