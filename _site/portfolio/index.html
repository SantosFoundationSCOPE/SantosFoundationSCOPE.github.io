            <p>Goal: Design a visual interface that presents relevant and useful information while keeping the driver’s eyes on the road. This interface should be highly customizable to provide only prioritized alerts and not overwhelm the driver with irrelevant, distracting, or frustrating information.</p>

<p>Issue: Drivers often need to take their eyes off of the road to control their car and view information. When road hazards do occur, bored and distracted drivers do not react quickly enough. Drivers do not have much control over how information is presented to them.</p>

<p>Solution: By creating a fully customizable heads-up display system we would be able to highlight important information and “gamify” driving to a point that the drivers may be more engaged in their commutes. We would also be able to draw their attention to potential threats or situations through the front windshield display.</p>

<p>One feature that interested drivers was displaying the suggested speed limit for certain roads based on live weather and road conditions. There is more weight given to dynamic signs than to those that haven’t been adjusted despite differences between when it was set up and the current environment.</p>

<p>“I’d feel better if speed limits were based on actual conditions” -Co-design partner, car modification hobbyist</p>

<p>This augmented reality also has the option of highlighting existing traffic rules specific to an area. filtering out only the information relevant to their situations. For example, many drivers were excited about a visual signal within the car park in a certain area. Others were interested in the idea of internal displays of turning options.</p>

<p>Other more basic aspects of this visual alert system could be integrating GPS mapping into the heads up display and highlighting road lines in rainy, night time, and foggy weather conditions. Such features could mitigate confusion and stress for a driver in unfamiliar or unfavorable conditions.</p>

<p>The system also has the potential to tap into the car’s data and display miles left before running out of gas, current speed, fuel economy. Things especially like fuel economy can be used as a way to both train drivers to drive more efficiently and create a more interesting overall driving experience.</p>

<p>What’s out there: HUDWAY is a smart phone head’s up display. This app relies on the contrasting light from the smartphone reflecting off the front windshield. A major downside is the clarity of the image and the strength of the projection on the window, which does not work during the daytime or when there are glares from other light sources.</p>

<p>NAVDY is another current technology available that is essentially a small projector and semitransparent screen that is mounted on the driver side dashboard. While projecting important information and being highly interactive through touchless gestures and voice activation, the screen space is very limiting.</p>

          <div class="details">
            <p>Develop a network in which people can interact as drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians.</p>

<p>A communication system with preset messages that can be verbally chosen from by a user would filter out any inappropriate (rude or hateful) language and express a user’s concerns in a clear, constructive way. Our current methods of on-road communication involve horns, flashing headlights, and obscenities. While these methods convey a limited range of ideas, they are often ambiguous and do not use driver identity. Quick messages could convey information to a wider range and be less likely to be brushed off or exacerbate the situation.</p>

<p>In order to report dangerous behavior, drivers must follow the reckless driver, remember a license plate, and call the authorities. By minimizing the activation energy required to report dangerous behavior, drivers will be empowered to take action and protect their roads. The users we have co-designed with are, in the moment, willing to provide ample information about the threat (car color, current location, license plate if visible, etc). After exiting the effect range of the threat, they rarely feel a need to report it. A concern for this reporting system would be false positives. However, people generally understand the if several users report the same situation, action could be taken.</p>

<p>A final use of this network would be tracking positioning of all nearby road users using their Bluetooth devices. Many accidents are a result of thwarted expectations or limited visibility. To address this problem, we can alert users to others, so that they can react to situations that could have surprised them. This can be as simple as alerting a car that is preparing to make a right turn to a bicyclist who approaches on the right. This would encourage the driver to pause a few seconds before turning and keep everyone safe. Ideally this system would adjust its sensitivity for the situation in which it is used. Urban drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians do not need a warning for every other road user, but a user in a very rural and dark setting may alerts for any pedestrian or cyclist who might elude their vision..</p>

<p>What’s out there: The current wearable technology utilizes people’s fascination with their own behavior and desire to record their daily habits. The Bluetooth and GPS abilities are growing in popularity. Much of the same technology can be applied to this project.</p>

<p>Bitlock is a keyless bike lock that works with a mobile app to unlock or lock a bike given the proper password. The lock is located on one of the wheels and comes with a GPS tracker in case the bike is ever stolen.</p>

          <h3>Modular Add-Ons</h3>
          <img class="post_image_big" src="/img/solution_images/AddOns.png" width="900px"/>
          <div class="details">
            <p>Goal: Create a modular platform from which drivers can install the latest safety technologies without interfering with the aesthetics of their car. A platform with low cost and easy installation will provide drivers of all backgrounds access to the same safety technologies and hopefully speed up the trickle down effect of largely luxury safety features.</p>

<p>Issues: Old cars do not have today’s safety features, the fleet turnover rate is approximately 20 years. Drivers wait for pre-installed features rather than purchase today’s aftermarket products. Older cars are difficult to personalize with features like lane detection or back up cameras because cars are so closed source.</p>

<p>Solution: Create a basis outside of the closed car system that enables drivers to install the new gadgets. The platform should still be able to tap into the car’s data but should not rely on integrating with the car. By creating attractive and readily available add-ons, people do not feel the need to buy cars based on the features.</p>

<p>Re-design and prototype different forms of currently available technology that can be easily installed onto the car. Keep add-ons very “subtly present” to prevent altering the look and feel of the car.</p>

<p>Additionally, this installable platform could potentially become a basis for new technology. In addition to connecting sensors from the body of the car, the system could also integrate driver monitoring devices.</p>

<p>What’s out there: There are installable back up cameras available in China for anywhere between $25 and $150. Many of the current systems require drilling into the buyer’s car, conspicuous sensors, and unwieldy wiring methods.</p>

<p>backup camera feeds which replace rearview and side mirrors allow for a wider field of vision and maintain the same driver interaction</p>

          <h3>Jarvis for Your Car</h3>
          <img class="post_image_big" src="/img/solution_images/Jarvis.png" width="900px"/>
          <div class="details">
            <p>Goal: Utilize voice recognition and audible alerts to create a highly interactive system that acts as the “perfect passenger” during commutes. The system would be customized and learn how the driver likes to be interacted with and adjust accordingly.</p>

<p>Problem: Lack of engagement with their commutes and driving experience. Desire for customizability and control for what information is presented to the driver. Limitations of human reaction time and awareness.</p>

<p>Solutions: A verbal car interface that acts as a secondary passenger without the annoyances of being a backseat driver. Additionally, the ideal passenger would encourage better driving habits, such as seatbelt use and By creating an interface specifically for the needs of a driver behind the wheel, we would eliminate much of the unnecessary distractions that the currently available technology comes with. A centralized hub of all data and information relevant to the driving experience.</p>

<p>Design an interface that is far more conversant and able to take verbal cues from the driver to adjust to the situation. An activation command like “Okay Google” could be used to tell the GPS system that the driver knows he is redirecting the route. Another instance would be a driver familiar with the majority of the route but only needing to know “is it a left or a right turn to Sudbury Farms from here?” which signifies to the system that was always live, that the driver would then like its input.</p>

<p>Verbal activation would be a hands free method of easily accessing information for the driver and can tap into directions, points of interest, cellular applications, and car data. Information that would otherwise require clicking through multiple layers of different mediums would be able to be accessed through a simple statement from the user.</p>

<p>What’s out there: SIRI, Cortana, Google Now are the currently available conversation-like interfaces between users and technology. While useful and elegant in their own ways, these applications are not designed to fully integrate with the driving experience. By using these as a basis for interaction, we can create a similar platform but dedicated to on road use that can also access data about the car and the car’s environment. Such an open source platform can allow drivers to verbally access the information they want in a single, quick step.</p>
