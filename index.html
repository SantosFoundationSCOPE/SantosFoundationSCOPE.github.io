        <h3> Our Mission </h3>
		The <a href='http://www.olin.edu/'>Santos Family Foundation</a> was created to improve automotive safety, with a emphasis on decreasing vehicular fatalities.  This summer, a 4 student team was tasked to translate this goal into a <a href='http://www.olin.edu/collaborate/scope/'>Senior Capstone Project</a> (SCOPE) at the <a href='http://www.olin.edu/'>Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering</a>.  Our sponsor would like for the SCOPE team to not only have richly educationaly experience, but also that the product of their labor may spark greater action from drivers, the government and the auto industry, in a grassroots, bottom-up manner. <br />

    <div id="description">

        We worked with experts and drivers to understand the values and problems within this field. Our results include four project ideas, and a careful documentation of these ideas and the process used to arrive at them. Both the Santos Foundation and the Summer Team hope to improve safety by designing for the drivers and sparking greater actions by drivers, government, and the auto industry<br /><br />

        <b>Through these interviews we have developed 5 major design principles:</b><br />
    </div>
	<a id='PRINCIPLES'></a>
    <div class="design_principles">
        <span class="des_title">Focus on prevention over mitigation. </span>
            Considering the 1-3 year time scale, and the available facilities and funding granted to a SCOPE project, we decided to focus on the prevention of accidents as opposed to the survivability of crashes. By designing products that alert drivers and prepare them to respond in a timely and safe manner, we can intervene before the crash. For example, five more seconds to react can often prevent a crash entirely. Designing technology to add onto cars is potentially just as effective as redesigning cars for survivability while being a fraction of the cost.
    </div>
    <div class="design_principles">
        <span class="des_title"> Design for the road users.</span>
           Many of the features users purchase are a result of industry marketing. In order to impact the greatest number of people, we decided to design for and around the users directly. Additionally, by appealing to users in the aftermarket, the team will sidestep the regulations and red tape of industry. Our intent is for the industry to see people using these technologies and adopt them as well.

    </div>
    <div class="design_principles">
        <span class="des_title">Empower people with the tools and motivation to driver better.</span>
             Social norms are often able to drive changes in behavior and thus, potential increases in safety. For example, drunk driving has become taboo in social settings. By convincing users to assume a higher driving standard and offering them the technology to do it, we can raise the norms of driving safety.
    </div>
    <div class="design_principles">
        <span class="des_title">Embed safety into desirable features.</span>
            Embed safety into desirable features. Society emphasizes the need for public safety. However, individuals are not willing to sacrifice the character, comfort, and functionality of their vehicle for improved safety. While safety ratings and features are nice to have, many users do not prioritize it in their personal vehicle choice.

    </div>
    <div class="design_principles">
        <span class="des_title">Facilitate the rise of autonomous cars.</span>
             Nearly all of the users and experts met with over the summer believed in the inevitability of vehicles moving towards autonomy. However, while technology closes the gap between the goal and reality, driving culture and legal infrastructure will take years to adapt to autonomous cars. By slowly integrating pieces of autonomous vehicles and handing over control piece by piece, we can expedite the rise of autonomous vehicles without making the public feel threatened by their presence.

    <b>Alisha Sarang-Sieminski</b>, is our summer faculty advisor. As the director of the SCOPE program here at Olin College, she offers insight into maximizing the success of every SCOPE project for both the students and the sponsors. Her influence and connections also helped our team reach out to faculty and experts with whom to co-design. Alisha has been with us through everything, and she has been instrumental in moving this summer forward.

    <b>Paul Santos and his co-trustee and wife Anne Stuart </b> are our contacts with the Santos Family Foundation. They bring their foundationâ€™s mission to Olin in hopes of prompting a viral and innovative safety improvement from the bottom up. The foundation values improved automotive safety and furthering undergraduate education, not generating an economic profit.

    <b>Jenny Vaccaro </b> is a rising sophomore with interest is Design Engineering and education. Her goals when joining the team were to work on her writing and documentation skills, as well as obtain the design experience to succeed in User Oriented Collaborative Design (UOCD) a required course for sophomores at Olin.

    <b>Mindy Tieu </b> is a rising sophomore who plans to major in Mechanical Engineering. Her purpose this summer was to experience how engineers managed to solidify a mission into a physical product through the design process. While she did prefer to stay on the more tangible side of things, Mindy learned a lot about the large floating space between real world problems and designing a technology to address those problems.
