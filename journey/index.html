<h1>Project Journey</h1>
<p>The prompt for our work this summer was to find an engineering project within automobile safety. Our baseline understanding of motor safety was inconsistent and primarily limited to our own experiences. So, we took advantage of the resources available to us (people and online research) to gain a stronger understanding of the space.

<p>We reached out to and interviewed 18 experts. These individuals ranged from engineers to higher-ups in the automobile and insurance industries to driving educators and first responders. They gave us a spectrum of perspectives and insight which strongly influenced what the SCOPE team will pursue. Below, we list each expert who helped us along with their occupation and a key insight. We changed their names, place of work, and photos in order to protect their privacy.

<a id="STATS"><h2>Statistics and Situations</h2></a>
<p>We performed extensive background research to understand the wide-open space that is auto safety.
</p>
<h4>WHAT</h4>
<p>In 2012, motor vehicle collisions caused 33,561 fatalities in the United States, and were the leading cause of death in people aged 6-35 
<a href='http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811856.pdf'>NHTSA, 2013</a>  As a culture, we accept automobile crashes as inevitable. Even the language surrounding crashes- “accidents” -speaks to our society’s acceptance of their existence.
</p>
<p>We disagree with this passive acceptance. In order to combat it, we started by gaining a better understanding of the the current situation.
</p>

<a><h4>When and Where</h4></a>
<p>We started by exploring SITUATIONS which are, statistically speaking, more dangerous for users.</p>
<ul>
<li>The greatest number of accidents occur between 5-7 pm.</li>
<li>The greatest rate of accidents occurs between 12-4 am.
<a href='http://www.forbes.com/2009/01/21/car-accident-times-forbeslife-cx_he_0121driving.html'>Forbes Magazine, 2009</a>.</li>
<li>Three quarters (73%) of pedestrian deaths occur in urban areas in 2012.
<a href='http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811888.pdf'>NHTSA, 2014</a>.</li>
<li>“Fifty-two percent of reported crashes occurred five miles or less from home and a whopping 77 percent occurred fifteen miles or less from home.”
<a href='http://www.progressive.com/newsroom/article/2002/may/fivemiles/'>Progessive Insurance, 2002</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Who</h4>
<p>Drivers from certain demographics are more likely to be involved in accidents. In particular, each year 70% of traffic fatalities involve male drivers. 
<a href='http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs358/en/'>WHO, 2013</a>.  
Additionally, younger drivers cause a disproportionate number of accidents. Drivers between ages 20 and 24 make up 8% of licensed drivers, yet made up 13.1% of fatalities in 2009.
<a href='http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/2012/tables/12s1114.pdf'>US Census, 2012</a>.</p>
<p>We then looked at how individuals are introduced to driving. We learn how to interact with the road long before we reach driving age, and everything we learn and do could have implications for our safety. We lay out these instances in order to consider at which point we can intervene.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Culture and Stigmas of driving</li>
<li>Licensing and Insurance</li>
<li>Purchasing and Registering</li>
<li>Driver state choices</li>
<li>In the moment prevention while driving</li>
<li>Crash mitigation</li>
</ul>


<a id="HONING"><h2>Honing In</h2></a>
<p>After understanding the basic attitudes and facts at play, we set about synthesizing our view of the current auto safety situation.</p>
<h4>Why</h4>
<p>Based on these SITUATIONS, we considered which factors might be at play. Not surprisingly, situations with high traffic volume, such as rush hour and urban intersections, were more likely to result in collisions.
</p><p>Additionally, holidays were the most dangerous days of the year. Not only are more people on the roads, but there is statistically much more alcohol involved. This may also speak to why the hours between midnight and 4:00 am were the most dangerous, because over half of accidents at those hours involve alcohol. 
</p>
<p>But what causes drivers to perform less than their best? To understand, we came up with a range of DRIVER STATES which result in more dangerous driving? For example, the top three root causes of crashes are distracted driving, drunk driving, and speeding. The first two are DRIVER STATES, but the last is a behavior, which we will discuss later. The use of substances like alcohol, marijuana, and prescription medications topped our list, but we also looked into substance free STATES: boredom, fatigue, lack of engagement with the road, stress, and unfamiliarity with roads.
</p>
<h4>How</h4>
<p>The links between unsafe DRIVER STATES and SITUATIONS where collisions and deaths actually occur, of course, are the DIRECT CAUSES. These are the dangerous behaviors promoted by impaired, disengaged and distracted driving and include: increased response time, thwarted expectations, speeding, underestimating the danger of obstacles, and decreased visibility. Our goal thus becomes reducing the effects of the affected DRIVER STATES, which occur with frequency even with unimpaired driving.
</p>



<a id="SOLUTIONS"><h2>Transitioning to Solutions</h2></a>

<p>We understood the problem of auto safety at its current situation. However, if we want the SCOPE team to be able to prompt a major change in automobile safety, we had to examine how auto safety has evolved over time, and what today’s drivers are open to.
</p>
<h4>History of Auto Safety</h4>

<p>The history of auto safety solutions stretches back to the invention of automobiles, but we include here a brief timeline of some key moments and their effects on auto safety.
</p>
<ul>
<li>1965:Unsafe at any Speed
<p>“Written by Ralph Nader, this was a powerful attack on the attitude of car manufacturers to safety. It proved very influential in forcing through some much-needed changes.”
<a href='http://www.driveandstayalive.com/info%20section/history/history.htm'>Drive and Stay Alive, 2003</a>.</p>
<p>“Ralph Nader's book "Unsafe at Any Speed" speculated that seat belts and airbags together could prevent thousands of deaths in car accidents.”
<a href='http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/federal-legislation-makes-airbags-mandatory'>History.com, 2014</a>.</p></li>
<p>This resulted in a greater push from drivers and government for the auto industry to create safer vehicles.
</p>	
</li>
<li>1980s: Drinking Age Change 
<p>"Raising the drinking age has a direct effect on reducing alcohol-related traffic accidents among youths affected by the laws, on average, across the states" 
<a href='http://www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/research/FewerYoungDrivers/iv__what_caused.htm'>NHTSA, 2000</a>. </p>
<p>“More lives have been saved in the last two years alone by safety belts and airbags than have been saved in the 22 years since the adoption of Legal Age 21”
<a href='http://www.chooseresponsibility.org/legal_age_21/'>Choose Responsibility, 2009</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>1986: Seat Belts 
<p>“It became compulsory for drivers and front seat passengers to wear seat belts and rear seat belts had to be fitted to new cars. In 1988 children had to wear rear seat belts where fitted, and in 1991 this was extended to all passengers.” 
<a href='http://www.driveandstayalive.com/info%20section/history/history.htm'>Drive and Stay Alive, 2003</a>.</p>
<p>“Since FARS started collecting data in 1975, seat belts have prevented over 280,000 fatalities and 7.2 million serious injuries”
<a href='http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/812013.pdf'>NHTSA, 2014</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>1998: Federal Legislation makes airbags mandatory
<p>”Researchers estimate that air bags reduce the risk of dying in a head-on collision by 30 percent, and they agree that the bags have saved more than 10,000 lives since the late 1980s.”
<a href='http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/federal-legislation-makes-airbags-mandatory'>History.com, 2014</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Ideas and Co-design</h4>
<p>After understanding the process by which accidents occur, and also what has been done to address auto safety in the past, our team felt ready to pursue a solution space for the future SCOPE team. This part of the process brought out our design principles, as we considered the future SCOPE team and our sponsor. We returned to the temporal layout of a driver’s introduction to driving, to see where we could make a difference. We decided that cultural or educational materials will not create a project with a strong enough engineering focus. We also found that our limited resources would not allow us to influence crash mitigation technology, because hugely expensive projects by vehicle manufacturers with decades of experience are unlikely to have missed any low-hanging fruit. 
</p>
LINK TO DESIGN PRINCIPLES![refer back to design principles. don’t reinvent the wheel] 

<p>We ultimately decided to focus our efforts on in-the-moment prevention for drivers. As we outlined in the HOW section above, the DIRECT CAUSES of accidents occur no matter what when and who is driving. Therefore, we want to encourage drivers in any DRIVER STATE to obey traffic laws, respond to hazards quickly, and make the correct judgment in the moment.
</p>
<h3>"The best technologies are those that empower people.”</h3>
<h5>Cody, motorcycle designer and bike enthusiast</h5>



<p>Our team ideated based on these key insights from our experts and from our statistics. These include all sorts of possible solutions, from every step of the driving introduction process and intended for use in all sorts of driving situations. We plotted these against their feasibility for the allotted budget and time, desirability in meeting our goals, and viability as a strong engineering project based on our design principles.
</p>
<p>Our favorite ideas ended up converging on in-the-moment prevention, because they excelled in both viability as an engineering project and feasibility with our project’s limitations. After selecting our ideas, we then drew up approximately 20 gallery sketches. This exercise gave us greater insight into the goals and possible implementation of each idea. We sorted our ideas by what problems they address, and also how they affect the driving experience, and realized that many of our ideas were simply attributes of a larger, encompassing project. 
</p>
<p>We then brought these more fleshed out project ideas back to drivers for co-design. We worked with drivers of all ages, who drive all sorts of cars, and who drive distances ranging from under 10 miles per week to over 200. The graphic below shows the various driving habits and demographics that we covered. We tried to hit drivers in both extremes of every category. When working with a larger user group, if you can please both extremes, you often end up creating a product which addresses middle-of-the-road users as well.
</p>
<p>By observing their driving habits and sharing our ideas, we were able to narrow and converge about 20 ideas down to four key PROJECT IDEAS. We believe that these ideas will be viable as projects, that they will improve auto safety, and that users are interested in adopting them. To learn more, continue to our PROJECTS page.
