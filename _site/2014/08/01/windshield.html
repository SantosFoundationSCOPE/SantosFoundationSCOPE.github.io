		<p>Goal: Design a visual interface that presents relevant and useful information while keeping the driver’s eyes on the road. This interface should be highly customizable to provide only prioritized alerts and not overwhelm the driver with irrelevant, distracting, or frustrating information.</p>

<p>Issue: Drivers often need to take their eyes off of the road to control their car and view information. When road hazards do occur, bored and distracted drivers do not react quickly enough. Drivers do not have much control over how information is presented to them.</p>

<p>Solution: By creating a fully customizable heads-up display system we would be able to highlight important information and “gamify” driving to a point that the drivers may be more engaged in their commutes. We would also be able to draw their attention to potential threats or situations through the front windshield display.</p>

<p>One feature that interested drivers was displaying the suggested speed limit for certain roads based on live weather and road conditions. There is more weight given to dynamic signs than to those that haven’t been adjusted despite differences between when it was set up and the current environment.</p>

<p>“I’d feel better if speed limits were based on actual conditions” -Co-design partner, car modification hobbyist</p>

<p>This augmented reality also has the option of highlighting existing traffic rules specific to an area. filtering out only the information relevant to their situations. For example, many drivers were excited about a visual signal within the car park in a certain area. Others were interested in the idea of internal displays of turning options.</p>

<p>Other more basic aspects of this visual alert system could be integrating GPS mapping into the heads up display and highlighting road lines in rainy, night time, and foggy weather conditions. Such features could mitigate confusion and stress for a driver in unfamiliar or unfavorable conditions.</p>

<p>The system also has the potential to tap into the car’s data and display miles left before running out of gas, current speed, fuel economy. Things especially like fuel economy can be used as a way to both train drivers to drive more efficiently and create a more interesting overall driving experience.</p>

<p>What’s out there: HUDWAY is a smart phone head’s up display. This app relies on the contrasting light from the smartphone reflecting off the front windshield. A major downside is the clarity of the image and the strength of the projection on the window, which does not work during the daytime or when there are glares from other light sources.</p>

<p>NAVDY is another current technology available that is essentially a small projector and semitransparent screen that is mounted on the driver side dashboard. While projecting important information and being highly interactive through touchless gestures and voice activation, the screen space is very limiting.</p>
