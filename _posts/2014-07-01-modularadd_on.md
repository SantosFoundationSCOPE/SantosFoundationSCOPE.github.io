<h2>Modular Add-Ons</h2>

<h4>Goal<h4>
<p>Create a modular platform from which drivers can install the latest safety technologies without interfering with the aesthetics of their car. A platform with low cost and easy installation will provide drivers of all backgrounds access to the same safety technologies and hopefully speed up the trickle down effect of largely luxury safety features. 
</p>
<h4>Issues</h4>
<ul>
<li>Old cars do not have today’s safety features, the fleet turnover rate is 20 years. </li>
<li>Drivers wait for pre-installed features rather than purchase today’s aftermarket products. </li>
<li>Older cars are difficult to personalize with features like lane detection or back up cameras because cars are so closed source.</li>
</ul>
<h3>"I want the options to purchase without getting into the premium market"</h3>
<p><strong>Bob, Engineer and Driving Simulation Professor</strong></p>

<h4>Solution</h4>
<p>Create a basis outside of the closed car system that enables drivers to install the new gadgets. The platform should still be able to tap into the car’s data but should not rely on integrating with the car. By creating attractive and readily available add-ons, people do not feel the need to buy cars based on the features.
</p>
<p>Re-design and prototype different forms of currently available technology that can be easily installed onto the car. Keep add-ons very “subtly present” to prevent altering the look and feel of the car.  
</p>
<p>Additionally, this installable platform could potentially become a basis for new technology. In addition to connecting sensors from the body of the car, the system could also integrate driver monitoring devices.
</p>

<h4>What’s out there</h4>
<p>There are installable back up cameras available in China for anywhere between $25 and $150. Many of the current systems require drilling into the buyer’s car, conspicuous sensors, and  unwieldy wiring methods.
</p>
<p><strong>PEAK</strong> backup camera feeds which replace rearview and side mirrors allow for a wider field of vision and maintain the same driver interaction.
</p>

<h4>Evidence of Impact</h4>
<ul>
<li>Addresses increased response time</li>
<li>Avoids thwarted expectations</li>
<li>Impaired driving
<p>“Alcohol-involved crashes resulted in 13,323 fatalities, 430,000 nonfatal injuries”
<a href='http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/812013.pdf'>NHTSA, 2010</a>.</p></li>
<li>Back-up camera availability
<p>“There are 210 fatalities and 15,000 injuries per year caused by backover accidents, the agency said. Children under 5 and adults 70 and older account for more than half of all backover fatalities each year. NHTSA said that 58 to 69 lives will be saved each year once all cars and light trucks on the road have this technology.” <a href='http://www.thedetroitbureau.com/2014/03/all-new-vehicles-must-have-backup-cameras-by-2018/'>Detroit Bureau, 2014</a>.</p></li>
